# LeapMotionProjects

SnakeLeap is a game inspired from Snake and developped by Frederic Debraine. The game is programmed through Processing in Java and uses the LeapMotion as a sensor to control the snake. Once launched, the LeapMotion device detect the hand's orientation - pitch and roll - which enables the snake to move.

Note 1 : Before launching the game in Processing, make sure you have downloaded the library "LeapMotion" by Michael Heuer.
